## HELLO I'M /setonwebber! 

I am a 21-year-old student currently studying a Bachelor in Computer Science, with a major in Software Engineering.
I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, C, Ruby, HTML, and SQL. 

### Right now im working on: 
#### Portfolio website
Currently my priority is working on a website that I can use to showcase all my previous and future projects, as well as use as a project in of itself. This website is static and it just run off HTML, but I'm interested in transitioning it into a dynamic website to spice it up. Would be a fun project to test my creative side as well as practice with coding and designing a complete project.

#### Discord bot
More of a personal project, I'll be working on a discord bot for my friends that helps us gain information on some of the games we play, the aimed functionality includes:
- Playing music (obviously)
- Organising tournaments
  	- Point keeping
  	- Randomizing a bracket
  	- Leaderboard in total
  	- Work independantly per game
- Movie nights
  	- Users can add movies to a pool of movies
  	- Will randomly chose a movie off entered criteria (genre, length, etc...)
  	- Users can rate movies.
  	  	- Movies randomly chosen from pool will be weighted more towards movies that are rated high in our group.

#### Project [havent thought of a name].
A dream project of mine is to work on a small incremental game, similar to cookie clicker (just one of those games you can turn your brain off for) while also combining aspects of automation and object placing (similar to factorio and shapez). The game idea is ever evolving and I'm unsure the direction its going to take, but thats for **later** me to sort out.

### Outside of programming!
I absolutely adore music when I'm programming and in my free time. Music is one of the other major things in my life and I can't get enough of it. I try to create my own in my spare time, while incorporating programming aspects into it. 
I mostly utilize Sonic Pi to create weird intricate beaps and boops that I love to use when producing my own random ambient works!

Other than that I enjoy film. Film is very important to me and I could rave on and on about my favourite movies. My 4 favourities currently are:
- Raw
- Titane
- Her
- Lost in translation

p.s. i love listening to film soundtracks, best of both worlds
